# Overview ðŸ“–

**ComputeSharp.D3D12MemoryAllocator** is an extension library for **ComputeSharp** to enable using [D3D12MA](https://gpuopen.com/d3d12-memory-allocator/) as the memory allocator for graphics resources.

# Quick start ðŸš€

You can configure the D3D12MA allocator by using the `AllocationServices` type at startup:

```csharp
AllocationServices.ConfigureAllocatorFactory(new D3D12MemoryAllocatorFactory());
```

This will make **ComputeSharp** leverage D3D12MA for all subsequent resource allocations.
