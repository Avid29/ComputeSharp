# Overview ðŸ“–

**ComputeSharp.Dxc** is an extension library for **ComputeSharp** bundling the DXC compiler and enabling shader reflection.

For users that are familiar with the HLSL language and might want to access more info on a given shader generated by ComputeSharp, such as the compiled HLSL code or the statistics exposed by the DirectX 12 reflection APIs, the library includes a ReflectionServices class that allows to easily gather all these details on a given shader type.

# Quick start ðŸš€

Assuming we have a `MyShader` type defined, here's how you can use **ComputeSharp.Dxc** to inspect it:

```csharp
ShaderInfo shaderInfo = ReflectionServices.GetShaderInfo<MainKernel>();

// Access info here, for instance...
string hlslSource = shaderInfo.HlslSource;
uint numberOfResources = shaderInfo.BoundResourceCount;
uint instructionCount = shaderInfo.InstructionCount;
```
