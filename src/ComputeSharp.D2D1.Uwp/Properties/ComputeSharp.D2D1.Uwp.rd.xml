      Ensure that MCG generates CCWs for PixelShaderEffect<T>.EffectFactory types. By default,
      this would not be the case, because the type only implements a single [ComImport] interface,
      which MCG assumes would only be used for native -> RCW scenarios. As such, without adding this
      directive, trying to QueryInterface on a CCW retrieved from an EffectFactory instance would
      throw a MissingInteropDataException. With this instead, the object can correctly be marshalled
      to native. This is necessary because the CCW is passed to Win2D as an ICanvasEffectFactoryNative.
